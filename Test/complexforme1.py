# Sum, Count and Average of Entered Numbers
# Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers.

# If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.

# Step 1 - Create a function which checks for numbers using try and except block.

# Step 2 - Inside while loop ask for input

# Step 3 - Calculate count, sum and average

# Enter a number: 2
# Enter a number: 4
# Enter a number: six
# Error, please enter numeric input
# Enter a number: 6
# Enter a number: done
# 12.0 3 4.0
